## About

#### Welcome to People's Open - a community-owned and operated wireless network for digital communications.

## Our Mission  

#### We are building a decentralized, libre network for the East Bay: we believe in the creation of local internets and locally-relevant applications, the cultivation of community-owned telecommunications networks in the interest of autonomy and grassroots community collaboration, and ultimately, in owning the means of production by which we communicate.

## Partners and Supporters

#### Partners like [sudomesh](http://sudomesh.org/) help develop software and assemble hardware systems to realize People's Open. Supporters like [Sudo Room](https://sudoroom.org) and [Omni Commons](https://omnicommons.org) provide space and resources for our workshops, meetings and storage space. Partners like the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) offer us free bandwidth to make the network more robust. There are many ways to partner with the project and support its development!
