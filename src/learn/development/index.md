## Development

The main development team of the People Open Network technology, [Sudo Mesh](https://sudomesh.org), is always seeking collaborators and contributors on various projects:
- Deploying a proof-of-concept test network in the [East Bay](http://www.geonames.org/5378538);
* Hosting services on the mesh, such as [an etherpad-lite instance](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Mesh/SudoPad), static copies of web pages, weather reporting, local commodity exchange;
* Maintaining our custom Open Wrt firmware, see [current issues](https://github.com/sudomesh/sudowrt-firmware/issues);
* [buildyourowninter.net](http://buildyourowninter.net), a collaborative resource for community network projects;
* [disaster.radio](https://disaster.radio), a disaster-resilient communications network powered by the sun;
* [Garden Mesh](https://peoplesopen.net/gardenmesh), a collaborative project with [Counter Culture Labs](https://www.counterculturelabs.org/);
* Keeping the [peopleopen.net website](https://github.com/sudomesh/peoplesopen-front) up-to-date;
* Help plan the next [BYOI workshop](https://peoplesopen.net/about/workshops)! Maybe it could take place in your neighborhood?

Our network and all of our projects use open content, open source software, and inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware. [The network](https://peoplesopen.net/learn/faqs) is designed to be replicable, and [our code](https://github.com/sudomesh), reusable. Feel [free (as in libre)](https://freedomdefined.org/Definition) to start your own People's Open Network.
