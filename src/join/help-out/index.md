## How You Can Help
Mesh networks don't happen by themselves, they require a ton of effort and a lot of collaboration. If you would like to help out, there are __several roles__ that anyone (with the right motivation) can fulfill.
        
### Community Organizer and/or Educator
Are you a people person? Would you like to help our network expand and provide access to those who need it most? Use your social skills to help get the word out. Talk to neighbors and local businesses about setting up a node in their buildings. Help plan events and workshops that raise awarness of community-run networks. Come to [our next workshop](https://peoplesopen.net/about/workshops) to see our current outreach and education methods in action.
        
### Legalistics and Grant Writing
Do you have expertise in law? Or are you good writer? Help us fight for digital liberties and equitable access to information, apply for grants and funding, and maybe even draft the next version of the Network Commons License. See more about our legal efforts [on our wiki](https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Mesh/Legal).

### Design and UX
Are you artiscally inclined? There are countless aspects of mesh networks that require design skills. Help improve our propaganda, re-design user interfaces, or create new diagrams and infographics. Check out our [open source, Creative Commons-licensed propaganda](https://github.com/sudomesh/propaganda) to see what have so far.

### Technical Support
Do you like scaling tall buildings? Are you a skilled troubleshooter? Help provide day-to-day management and maintenance of the mesh or assist in the deployment of nodes and roof-mounted antennae! If you'd like to join the node mounting crew, e-mail us at: nodemount [AT] peoplesopen [DOT] net.
    
### Multi-talented Engineer
Are you a hacker or programmer? Do you know how to use git? Even if you don't, we can teach you. Clone our repos, modify some code (or just edit a README), and become a contributor. To learn about the technology that drives mesh networks and how you can contribute to our various hardware/firmware/software/creative projects, visit our [development page](https://peoplesopen.net/learn/development).
    
If you are interested in filling any of these roles (or suggesting new ones). Stop by our <strong>weekly meetings, Tuesdays 7:30pm at the [Omni Commons](https://omnicommons.org/) and [Join the Network](https://peoplesopen.net/join).
